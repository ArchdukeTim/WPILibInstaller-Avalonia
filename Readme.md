# WPILibInstaller-Avalonia

Welcome to the WPILibInstaller repository, which hosts the source code used to install the various components, libraries, and applications of the wpilibsuite.

## Generating Installers

### Required Dependencies

- DotNetCore 5.0 or higher.
- Java 11

### Building

An installer can be generated by running the following command:

```
gradlew generateInstallers -PXmx3072m -PlinuxBuild -DsystemProp.org.gradle.internal.http.connectionTimeout=180000 -DsystemProp.org.gradle.internal.http.socketTimeout=180000 -PjenkinsBuild
```

``-PlinuxBuild`` can be replaced with the OS of your choice to build.

- ``-PlinuxBuild``
- ``-PmacBuild``
- ``-Pwindows32``

If no OS argument is given, it will default to building Windows 64. Additionally, the other gradle options ensure that the build has enough RAM and time needed to build properly. It's not recommended to build the installer if your system has less than 4GB of RAM.
